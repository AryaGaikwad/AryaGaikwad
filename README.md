# 🎓 My Coding Journey:
### I am Arya Gaikwad and I am pleased to share my journey in coding. My journey began with Python, where I started with the fundamentals, including datatypes and data structures. Expanded my knowledge to include pandas and numpy libraries for machine learning. Through solving various data problems, I honed my skills in data preprocessing and analysis. As a member of my college's Robotics club for a year, I gained experience with the Arduino toolkit, programming, and building bots. My interest in AI led me to explore further in the field of machine learning, and I am currently studying deep learning. Additionally, I have a foundational understanding of natural language processing and am actively conducting research in this field.
