<h1 align="center">Howdy, I'm Arya Gaikwad!</h1>

# 💫 About Me:
🎓 I'm a second year Masters in Data Science student at UCSD graduating in March 2026<br>
Turning data into decisions and AI into impact. I build ML systems that solve real business problems, from predictive modeling at scale to deploying production-grade AI pipelines.<br>

# 🎯 What I Do:
- Customer Segmentation & Predictive Modeling (XGBoost, scikit-learn, SHAP explainability)<br>
- LLM & RAG System Development (LangChain, OpenAI, FastAPI, vector search)<br>
- Data Engineering at Scale (PySpark, Databricks, Snowflake, AWS, SQL)<br>
- A/B Testing & ROI Analysis (causal inference, statistical modeling)<br>
- Data Storytelling for Stakeholders (Tableau, PowerBI, matplotlib)<br>

# 📊 Recent Impact:
- Shaped targeting strategy for a $134M loyalty campaign at American Airlines by evaluating a $1M third-party data investment through ML modeling and customer segmentation.
- Shipped a real-time AI system serving 44K+ companies in under 50 seconds at Textify.ai.
- Building a supply chain AI agent to turn demand unpredictability into actionable decisions.

🔍 Seeking full-time roles where I can own the full cycle, from shaping the problem to shipping the model. Open to Product Data Scientist, Data Scientist, ML Engineer, AI Engineer, or NLP Engineer roles. 2026 start.

# 💻 My Coding Journey:
My coding journey started with Python and Java during undergrad, where I fell in love with solving problems through code. Over time, I've built a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns through C++, while expanding into web development with HTML, CSS, React, and Node.js. Python became my go-to for everything ML and data related. I've gotten deep into NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn for modeling, PyTorch and TensorFlow for deep learning, and NLTK, spaCy, and Gensim for NLP. I've also worked extensively with LangChain for building RAG systems, OpenCV for computer vision, and FastAPI/Flask for deploying models as production APIs. On the data engineering side, I'm comfortable writing optimized SQL across MySQL, PostgreSQL, Teradata, and MongoDB, and I use PySpark for distributed computing. I work in Jupyter Notebooks and VS Code daily, manage everything through GitHub, and rely on tools like Docker and cloud platforms (AWS, Databricks, Snowflake) to ship code that scales. For me, coding isn't just about syntax. It's about building systems that work and solving real problems end-to-end.
