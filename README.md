<h1 align="center">Howdy, I'm Arya Gaikwad!</h1>

# 💫 About Me:
🎓I'm second year Masters in Data Science student at UCSD graduating in March 26<br>
Turning data into decisions and AI into impact. I build ML systems that solve real business problems, from predictive modeling at scale to deploying production-grade AI pipelines.<br>

# 🎯 What I Do:<br>
Customer Segmentation & Predictive Modeling (XGBoost, scikit-learn, SHAP explainability)<br>
LLM & RAG System Development (LangChain, OpenAI, FastAPI, vector search)<br>
Data Engineering at Scale (PySpark, Databricks, Snowflake, AWS, SQL)<br>
A/B Testing & ROI Analysis (causal inference, statistical modeling)<br>
Data Storytelling for Stakeholders (Tableau, PowerBI, matplotlib)<br>

# 📊 Recent Impact:<br>
- Shaped targeting strategy for a $134M loyalty campaign at American Airlines by evaluating a $1M third-party data investment through ML modeling and customer segmentation.<br>
- Shipped a real-time AI system serving 44K+ companies in under 50 seconds at Textify.ai.<br>
- Building a supply chain AI agent to turn demand unpredictability into actionable decisions.<br>

🔍 Seeking full-time roles where I can own the full cycle, from shaping the problem to shipping the model. Open to Product Data Scientist, Data Scientist, ML Engineer, AI Engineer, or NLP Engineer roles. 2026 start.<br>
